# RANK-OF-A-MATRIX
## Aim:
To write a python program to find the rank of a matrix
## Equipment’s required:
1. 	Hardware – PCs
2. 	Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner
## Algorithm:
### Step 1: Import numpy,which provides efficient method to work with matrix and compute their ranks
### Step 2: Create a matrix to find the rank.You can define as list or lists or numpy array
### Step 3: Using the np.linalg.matrix_rank(), we can find the rank of the given matrix.
### Step 4: End the program
## Program:
#Program to find the rank of a matrix.
#Developed by: SWETHA S V
#RegisterNumber: 212224230285
import numpy as np
a = np.array([[1,2,3],[3,6,9]])
sol = np.linalg.matrix_rank(a)
print(sol)
## Output:
